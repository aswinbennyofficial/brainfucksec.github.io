## Introduction

This is my list of Privacy Alternatives of not so good mainstream products who use your data to make money and collaborate with governments for mass surveillance.
The list is compiled in a simple way, privacy defence requires continuous research, so before using the apps on this list **do your own research** and if you find something wrong please [contact me](https://brainfucksec.github.io/contacts) so I can update it.

I do not sponsor or get paid by any of the organizations of the products listed.
When I choose to use a service it means that I have search information before, and I have my own opinion about it that may not be the same as other people in this sector.
I often read articles where an application is declared not private and insecure without consistent sources which confirm the claims, or where it's declared reliable and instead it's a honeypot.

Security is a process, so you cannot fully trust any application, organization, and the people behind it.
Regarding this topic see:

[Threat Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model)

[Defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing))

I hope this modest work can help to defende you and fight the censorship and oppression we are experiencing especially in recent years, **knowledge is power**, so search, read, and think with your head!
In this sector it's very easy to meet organizations and projects that claim to defend privacy but in reality are just mousetraps.

**Only products that meet the following requirements are included in the list:**

* Open source software and clear references to the application source code, I know that a closed source program doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious, but but I prefer to know that there's code available for everyone to read.

* Clear references to the development team and organization (i.e. "About Me" section).

* Privacy Policy clear and easily accessible, if I have to click for 10 pages before reading a complicated and obscure privacy policy I consider that is something wrong.

* Not sharing data with bad third parties (i.e. No Google, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Cloudflare and other evil companies), about that argument see: [Notes](#notes)

* Not sharing data with Data Brokers, this is sometimes hard to determine, as above, "do you own research", and if there is anything wrong with a product on the list, please let me know.

* The project/application must be updated and actively maintained, (with exceptions, some applications may be valid even if updated some time ago).

### Notes

About organizations that use third party software I think a clarification should be made.
Often it's necessary to use third party services in order to make them stable and working, examples are Proton or Signal services that use some Amazon AWS or Google servers for traffic routing.
